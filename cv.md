About me

The start of my career was working in technical support for domains. This allowed me to improve my personal soft skills. Including the rapid development of new information.

At my current place of work, I believe that I have reached the maximum in professional development, so I decided to start studying a new direction for myself - Frontend development.

Now I am improving my theoretical and practical knowledge in this area.
